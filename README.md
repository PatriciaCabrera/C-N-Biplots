# C-N-Biplots
This repository consist in a script to create Carbon and Nitrogen biplots

This script creates classic isotope biplot with the means and error bars in both directions, so first I need to create summary data for each of the coral species. So I create a new object called "Summary" where I calculate the mean, sd, min and max for each group and I will name the mean of iso1 as "mC" for meanCarbon, the standard deviation of iso1 as "sdC", min value of iso1 as "minC" and max value of iso1 as "maxC"... and similarly for N and S.
